            <h3 id="tet">Tết (Vietnamese New Year)</h3>
                <p>If you're in the area during the New Year, called Tết, Hoi An is transformed into a kaleidoscope of colour and <br>light for its Lantern Festival. The celebration lasts for seven days, with the road from Hoi An Bridge to the<br> Hoai River Square adorned with thousands of colourful lanterns. The heart of the festivities is in the old town, <br>between the Japanese Covered Bridge and the Cau An Hoi Bridge. It’s crowded, chaotic and festive, with <br>spontaneous singing and food stalls at every turn. It is as much a celebration for locals as it is for visitors. <br>There are also smaller lantern festivals held on each full moon.</p>
            <h3 id="mid-autumn">Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
                <p>This popular festival belongs to the children but is still fun for adults too. With ancient roots rich in myth and <br>legend, travellers will delight in seeing kids performing lion dances and participating in street processions. <br>It’s also customary to give and receive Banh Trung Thu, or boxes of mooncakes, during this time. Filled with <br>lotus seeds, red beans and sometimes a yoke from a salted egg to represent the moon, don’t miss tasting this <br>traditional festival food.</p>
